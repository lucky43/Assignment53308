 David Brunelle <br/> 10/13/14 <br/> CSCI-3308 <br/> Question 1: The benifit of utilizing IaaS rather than a PaaS is that one has more control over their product. With PaaS terms and conditions for the provider <br/> can limit the output of one\'s product whereas IaaS is much less demanding. Additionally, PaaS requires constant updates from a company and as a result one is <br/> highly dependent on the changes that that company makes. Should that company no longer be reliable in maintaining the software, the user is  more or less out <br/> of luck. <br/> Question 2: There are many reasons why some software companies are anxious about moving their products to a cloud-based platform. One major concern which <br/> people have with this notion is the potential for large scale data loss. Because the hardware behind the Cloud is not typically on site, retrieving lost <br/> information can be much more of a hassle than simply extracting it from the hardware on your own personal computer. Additionally, Clouds force a certain level <br/> of dependence on their users by the company hosting that Cloud.
